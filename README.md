## Summary 

For this assignment i was tasked with building a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

Testing is key to making this code maintainable, so I have also wrote a unit test for every part of the code to  ensure that it passes each test.



## User Story

```
